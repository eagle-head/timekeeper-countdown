# Creating a New Release with Changesets

This guide outlines the steps to create a new release using Changesets, publish it to npm, and push the changes to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have `changesets` installed in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install @changesets/cli
   ```

2. Configure Changesets by running:

   ```bash
   npx changeset init
   ```

3. Make sure you have the necessary tokens configured in your `.npmrc` for npm publishing:

   ```plaintext
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_NPM_TOKEN
   ```

## Steps to Create a New Release

### Step 1: Create a Changeset

1. Run the following command to create a changeset:

   ```bash
   npx changeset add
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to specify the type of change (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) and provide a summary of the changes.

### Step 2: Update Versions

1. Run the command to update the versions and generate changelogs:

   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```

### Step 3: Commit Changes

1. Stage all changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit the changes with a meaningful message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Version packages for release vX.Y.Z"
   ```

### Step 4: Publish to npm

1. Run the command to publish the packages:

   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

### Step 5: Push Changes and Tags to GitHub

1. Push the changes to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

2. Push the tags to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

### Step 6: Create a New Release on GitHub

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on "Releases" on the right sidebar.
3. Click on "Draft a new release".
4. In the "Tag version" field, enter the new version number (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`).
5. In the "Release title" field, enter a title for the release (e.g., `Release vX.Y.Z`).
6. In the "Describe this release" field, you can use the changelog generated by Changesets. You can find the changelog in the `.changeset` directory. Copy the relevant entries and paste them here.
7. Click "Publish release".

## Additional Tips

- Ensure you have a clean working directory before starting the release process.
- Double-check that all tests pass and there are no linting errors before publishing.
- Review the generated changelogs and version numbers to confirm they are correct.

By following these steps, you will be able to create a new release, publish it to npm, and push the changes to GitHub, ensuring your project stays up-to-date and properly versioned.
