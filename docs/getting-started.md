# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Timekeeper Countdown** library! This guide will walk you through the process of getting the library installed and integrated into your project.

## Introduction

**Timekeeper Countdown** is a powerful yet simple countdown timer library for React and React Native. It offers easy-to-use functions to start, pause, reset, resume, and restart countdowns with support for time units like days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

If you're building a task timer, event countdown, or just need to keep track of time, this library is perfect for you!

## Installation

To install the library, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install timekeeper-countdown
```

This will add the library to your project's dependencies.

## Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the countdown timer in your React component:

```typescript
import { useCountdown } from "timekeeper-countdown";

const CountdownTimer = () => {
  const { days, hours, minutes, seconds, start, pause, reset } =
    useCountdown(3600); // 1 hour countdown

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Countdown Timer</h1>
      <div>
        {days} Days {hours} Hours {minutes} Minutes {seconds} Seconds
      </div>
      <button onClick={start}>Start</button>
      <button onClick={pause}>Pause</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, we initialize the timer with `3600` seconds (1 hour), and the user can start, pause, or reset the countdown.
